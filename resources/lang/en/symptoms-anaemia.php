    'infections'=>'Lowered resistance to infections',
    'system'=>'Iron is an essential nutrient that is required for the
                proper functioning of the immune system. When iron levels are low, the body may not
                be
                able to produce enough immune cells; this can lead to lowered resistance to
                infections,
                making it easier for viruses, bacteria, to take hold in the body.',
    'Loss' =>'Loss of appetite',  
    'may'=>'If the body may not be getting enough oxygen due to a lack of haemoglobin in the blood, which can cause feelings of fatigue, weakness, and malaise, and may reduce the desire to eat.',  
    'Iron' =>'Iron deficiency anaemia can lead to gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which may also contribute to a loss of appetite.',   
    'eyelid'=>'Whiteness in the inner portion of the eyelid', 
    'inner' =>'whitening of the inner portion of the eyelid, known as palpebral conjunctiva, This is due to decrease in the production of haemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen to the tissues of the body. Without enough haemoglobin, the tissues, including the conjunctiva, become pale or white.', 
    'nail'=>'Brittle nail (spoon shaped nail)',  
    'cause'=>'Iron is important for healthy nail growth, and a lack
          of iron in the body can cause nails to become brittle and break easily.', 
    'stomatitis'=>'Angular stomatitis',

            corners of the mouth. While iron deficiency is one possible cause of angular
            stomatitis',  
    'fatigues' =>'fatigue',    
    'Without'=>'Without enough iron, the body cannot produce enough haemoglobin, and as a
            result, there is a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the
            body s
            tissues and organs. This lack of oxygen can lead to fatigue, weakness, and shortness
            of
            breath.', 
    'nails'=>'Whiteness in nails and palms', 
    'produce'=>'When the body is low in iron, it cannot produce enough
            haemoglobin, leading to decreased oxygen levels in the blood and tissues. This lack
            of
            oxygen can cause a pale appearance in the skin, particularly in areas where blood
            vessels are close to the surface, such as the nails and palms.', 
    'Headachess'=>'Headaches',   
    'possible'=>'Headaches are a possible symptom of anemia. Some experts believe that iron is involved in making serotonin, a chemical messenger in the body. People who experience migraine have altered serotonin levels.',
